        <p>
        Being a college student can be very time consuming, and If you attend an institute such as Tech, it can also be extremely stressful. Out of this, Mental Health becomes a very concerning topic. This site works to address the lack of communication and information for those students with predispositions to mental health. We realize there are students who may still struggle with their own problems but not fit into the mental health category. Our goal is to welcome them in with open arms as well. This site will clearly display our concern for the enhancement of studentsâ€™ mental states, and work to help students better navigate our own-campus resources.
